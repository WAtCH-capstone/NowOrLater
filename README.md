## Messages when you want them.

Now or Later is a mobile messaging app which allows users to send and receive messages based on time and geolocation. Our front-end is built with React and React Native, and our backend is serviced by Google Cloud Firestore.

To try our app, `git clone` this repo, `npm install`, and run `npm start` in one terminal window and `react-native run-ios` in another. You'll need to have Xcode installed.
